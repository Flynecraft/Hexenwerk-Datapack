## Mod
- I am planning to port this datapack to a mod. As soon as i did that the datapack project will probably still get continued which continiously. This might delay updates but that is an acceptable tradeoff for me!
- Why am i doing this? 
I wanted to learn modding for some time now and i think this is the perfect opportunity to do so while also continuing making datapacks.
